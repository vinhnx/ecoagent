## 🎬 Demo Video - Script

**Keep it simple (90 seconds)**

```
[0-15s] "EcoAgent is an MCP server with 13 sustainability tools. 
         Let me show you how it works."

[15-45s] *Show Gradio interface loading*
         "This is the web interface. But what's special is—
         it's also an MCP server. I can use it with Claude Desktop."
         *Show Claude Desktop with EcoAgent endpoint added*

[45-75s] *Show Claude conversation using a tool*
         "I ask Claude: 'What's my carbon footprint for a 100-mile car trip?'
         Claude uses our tool to calculate. *Shows result: 7.8 lbs CO2*
         Then Claude gives recommendations based on real calculations."

[75-90s] "That's EcoAgent. Now any AI agent can access sustainability tools.
         Built for MCP's 1st Birthday hackathon."
