## Script (90 seconds)

### Scene 1: Introduction (15 seconds)

**Talking Head or Intro Text**

```
"Hi! I'm showing you EcoAgent, 
a consumer MCP server for sustainability.

It has 13 tools that help AI agents 
calculate carbon footprints and suggest 
eco-friendly alternatives."
```

**What to show**: Title screen, your name, EcoAgent logo (optional)

---

### Scene 2: Space Interface (15 seconds)

**Capture**: Live navigation of your HF Space

```
"This is the EcoAgent interface running 
on Hugging Face Spaces. But what's special 
is that it's also an MCP server."
```

**What to do**:
1. Load your Space URL in browser
2. Show the Gradio interface loading
3. Pan through interface showing tools list
4. Show the MCP endpoint URL

**Optional**: Read MCP endpoint aloud

---

### Scene 3: Tool Execution (30 seconds)

**Capture**: Using the web interface OR Claude Desktop (best)

#### Approach A: Web Interface (Simpler)
```
"Let me calculate carbon from a car trip. 
I input: 100 miles driven, 25 MPG car."

[Input values, click Execute]

"The result: 7.8 pounds of CO2. 
Easy carbon footprint calculation."
```

#### Approach B: Claude Desktop (More Impressive)
```
"But here's where it gets really interesting. 
I've added EcoAgent to Claude Desktop."

[Show Claude Desktop with EcoAgent available]

"I can ask Claude: 'What's my carbon footprint 
if I drive 100 miles in a 25 MPG car?'"

[Type question, show Claude using the tool]

"Claude automatically uses EcoAgent's calculation 
tool and explains the result: 7.8 lbs CO2."
```

**Best practices**:
- Pre-calculate sample data (don't calculate during recording)
- Use realistic examples
- Show clear, readable numbers
- Pause to let viewers understand

---

### Scene 4: Real-World Use (25 seconds)

**Capture**: Conversation or demonstration

**Approach A: Use Case Explanation**
```
"Here's why this matters:

Millions of people want to track their 
environmental impact. But they don't have 
easy access to accurate carbon calculations.

With EcoAgent, any AI agent—Claude, Cursor, others—
can now help users make sustainability decisions.

Calculate impact. Get recommendations. 
Take action. All in one conversation."
```

**Approach B: Live Example**
```
"Let me show a complete example:

User asks: 'Should I fly or drive to California?'

Claude calculates:
- Flying: ~450 lbs CO2
- Driving: ~1,200 lbs CO2

Flying is 60% less emissions!

That's the power of MCP—real data, 
real recommendations, real impact."
```

---

### Scene 5: Closing (5-10 seconds)

```
"EcoAgent is a complete MCP consumer server 
built for the MCP's 1st Birthday hackathon.

Check it out, integrate it with Claude, 
and help the environment!

Thanks for watching."
```

## Recording Steps

### Pre-Recording Setup

1. **Close distractions**
   - Close email, notifications, extra windows
   - Put phone on silent
   - Close unnecessary apps

2. **Test audio**
   - Record 5-second test
   - Check sound levels (not too loud, not too quiet)
   - Ensure no background noise

3. **Prepare content**
   - Have Space loaded in one browser tab
   - Have Claude Desktop open (if demoing)
   - Write down key numbers/examples
   - Have any visuals prepared

4. **Screen layout**
   - Maximize browser window
   - Use readable font size (zoom in if needed)
   - Hide sensitive info (API keys, etc.)

### During Recording

1. **Start recording**
   - Screen capture running
   - Audio input active
   - Confirm it's recording

2. **Deliver script**
   - Speak clearly and moderately
   - Go slower than normal (viewers need time to read)
   - Pause for important points
   - Don't rush through numbers/results

3. **Navigate naturally**
   - Use mouse to point at things
   - Scroll smoothly (not too fast)
   - Wait for pages to load completely
   - Show results clearly before moving on

4. **Stay on time**
   - Aim for 90-120 seconds
   - If you go over, edit in post-production
   - Leave small pauses between scenes

5. **Stop recording**
   - Include a few seconds of silence at end
   - Clearly mark where recording ends

### Post-Production (Optional but Recommended)

**If your video is too long or rough**:

Using DaVinci Resolve (free):
1. Import video
2. Cut out long pauses or mistakes
3. Add title screen at start (optional)
4. Speed up slightly if needed (1.05x-1.1x)
5. Export as MP4

## Recording Techniques

### Camera Position
- **Screen**: Centered, full-frame
- **Talking head**: Top 1/3 of frame (if including yourself)
- **Don't**: Shaky footage, too zoomed in/out

### Cursor/Mouse
- Move naturally, not too fast
- Point at important UI elements
- Highlight where users should look

### Pacing
- **Slow scene**: 3 seconds to understand
- **Fast scene**: Results, navigation
- **Important number**: Pause 2 seconds
- **Transitions**: 1 second blank

### Audio
- Clear, confident voice
- Medium pace (not rushed, not slow)
- No filler words ("um", "uh", "like")
- Background: Quiet (no music, no keyboard clicks)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too fast** - Viewers can't read or understand  
❌ **Too quiet** - Audio is inaudible  
❌ **Distracting tabs** - Close email, other apps  
❌ **Long pauses** - Cut them in editing  
❌ **Poor lighting** - Dim screen is hard to read  
❌ **No script** - "Um, uh, let me think..." (use a script)  
❌ **Showing API keys** - Hide/blur sensitive info  
❌ **Too long** - Keep it under 2 minutes

## Optimal Settings

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Resolution** | 1920x1080 (1080p) |
